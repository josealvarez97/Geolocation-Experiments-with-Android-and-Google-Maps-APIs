# Device Tracker (2)

I used Firebase Realtime Databases to track the location of mobile devices through the Google Maps API (I was trying to build something like Uber eats). Work was heavily in progress when I stopped (summer ended).
I may recommend to dive into [these classes](../master/DeviceTracker2/app/src/main/java/io/google/devicetracker2), which are very well commented and evidence what I learned to implement effectively, if the reader wants to take a look.
Currently, downloading the app is pointless since authentication is required (may do something about it in the future, although I'd prefer to start it again).
